 * I figured out how gradle plugins work from look at <a href="http://goo.gl/jbn8am">this</a> source code. Might of copied
 * them a lil bit. It's licensed under the Apache License 2.0, which can be viewed <a href="http://goo.gl/tPPd">here</a>.
 * List of changes:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>Made for JASIC rather then golo.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Sorry for being lazy on the list of changes. Please don't sue me. Golo is a cool programming language btw.
